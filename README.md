3. Start project via command
```./bin/dev```
4. After succesful start up, on address ```localhost``` you must see project main page, also you must go to ```localhost/api``` and
```localhost/admin```, and make sure you see drf and django.
5. Go to path frontend and run ```npm i```, you must run this locally, not in docker.
6. Run ```nmp start``` frontend path. Go to ```localhost:3000``` make sure that you see project main page. During dev you must work with frontend on this address, because ```localhost``` will not change when you made changes in code,  ```localhost:3000``` will change, cause it has webpack
